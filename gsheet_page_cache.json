Besides the moonshine night and geeks with guns, why do normally reasonable folks return year after year to Charlotte to gather around open source software. Now we put computer services in a container but can we can not contain pop up ads! We can store all sorts of stuff on Github but why do I still get spammers commenting on old MySpace pages?  And what year will really be the year of the Linux Desktop?  Did we need Meltdown to warn of of impeding doom or did that come with systemd?

Topics include a look at the components that make up the Document Store, using JSON documents with relational data, and building pure NoSQL solutions.
